bonFhir comes with a Command Line that implements some utilities to create bonFHIR applications and manage FHIR data.

The CLI and all commands support the `--help` flag to get information about flags:

```
npx @bonfhir/cli@latest --help
```

or

```
npx @bonfhir/cli@latest <command> --help
```

:::info[Version]

The `--version` flag can also output the CLI version currently in use.  
Using the moniker `@bonfhir/cli@latest` ensures that you always use the latest version of the package.

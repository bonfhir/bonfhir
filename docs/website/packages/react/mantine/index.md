```bash npm2yarn
npm install @bonfhir/mantine
```

The `@bonfhir/mantine` package provides renderers for the [Mantine toolkit v7](https://mantine.dev/).

It only uses components from Mantine, and will integrate very well with a Mantine application and all other Mantine components.

[Mantine must be installed and configured in the application](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) for the renderers to work properly.

We recommend that you use one of our templates to get started easily.  
Just run `npm create -y bonfhir@latest` to get started.

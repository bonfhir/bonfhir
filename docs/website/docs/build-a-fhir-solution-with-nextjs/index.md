title: Build a FHIR solution with Next.js
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

Create a full FHIR solution with a web app and an API using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template.

This tutorial will walk you through key BonFHIR concepts and every step of the process,
from setup to a fully functional web app with tables and inputs, and a functioning API.

:::info

This guide will go through the same process as the [React](/docs/build-a-fhir-app-with-react) and [AWS Lambda](/docs/build-a-subscription-api-with-aws-lambda),
except that its tailored to Next.js  
If you have already followed these tutorials you may find this redundant.

title: Setup a local FHIR Server
description: Use Medplum as a FHIR backend for development
---

BonFHIR can connect to any FHIR-based API. For local development, BonFHIR provides an easy setup and connect experience with [Medplum](https://www.medplum.com/) as a backend.

1. Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
2. In your project directory, start a [development-ready MedPlum](https://github.com/bonfhir/medplum-devbox) instance. **This is for development only and not for production use.**

   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm run fhir:start-server
   ```

3. Once the server is ready (look for a message saying "Server started"), open http://localhost:8100 and login using the default credentials:

   - Username: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `medplum_admin`
   - Project: Default

4. Import FHIR sample data into Medplum - Run the following command in a different terminal while the server is running:

   ```bash npm2yarn
   npm run fhir:add-sample-data
   ```

:::tip

You don't need to wait until the end of the import to keep going.
You can either let it finish while you move to the next step, or stop it once it has imported enough patients
for your liking.

5. Verify that patient data appears in MedPlum at http://localhost:8100/Patient

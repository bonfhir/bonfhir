# Welcome to Bonfhir

BonFHIR is a collection of projects and libraries to help implement [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/)-based products and solutions. Focus on building features by taking advantage of the comprehensive BonFHIR tooling that makes working with FHIR easier and faster:

- React UI components and state management built for FHIR resources and common healthcare use cases
- Type definitions for R4b and R5, including search builder parameters
- Localized formatters to present FHIR data in any language with support for names, dates, addresses and more
- A FHIR client that supports FHIR subscriptions, bundle navigation, dynamic proxies, batch execution, GraphQL and more!

## Get started

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

### Where to start

Start building your first FHIR client in 5 minutes by following this guide: **[Build a FHIR app with React](/docs/category/build-a-fhir-app-with-react)**.

Or select a template and start on your own:

```
npm create bonfhir
```

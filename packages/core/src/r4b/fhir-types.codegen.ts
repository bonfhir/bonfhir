 * that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would
 * need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.
 * When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing
 * the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it
 * understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this
 * is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason,
 * none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g.
 * chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able

Reference is intended to point to a structure
 * that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need

 * application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content
 * referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any
 * limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For
 * example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug
 * prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).  One of

The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Age\">Age</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Age</td>\n                    <td>Age Type: A duration of time during which an organism (or a process) has existed.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Age\">Age</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Age</td>\n                    <td>Age Type: A duration of time during which an organism (or a process) has existed.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-AllergyIntolerance\">AllergyIntolerance</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>AllergyIntolerance</td>\n                    <td>Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an individual and associated with exposure to a substance.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Annotation\">Annotation</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Annotation</td>\n                    <td>Annotation Type: A  text note which also  contains information about who made the statement and when.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Annotation\">Annotation</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Annotation</td>\n                    <td>Annotation Type: A  text note which also  contains information about who made the statement and when.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Appointment\">Appointment</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Appointment</td>\n                    <td>A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time.

A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. \n\nThe primary difference between a medicationstatement and a medicationadministration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medicationstatement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-MedicinalProductDefinition\">MedicinalProductDefinition</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>MedicinalProductDefinition</td>\n                    <td>Detailed definition of a medicinal product, typically for uses other than direct patient care (e.g. regulatory use, drug catalogs, to support prescribing, adverse events management etc.).</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-MessageDefinition\">MessageDefinition</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>MessageDefinition</td>\n                    <td>Defines the characteristics of a message that can be shared between systems, including the type of event that initiates the message, the content to be transmitted and what response(s), if any, are permitted.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-MessageHeader\">MessageHeader</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>MessageHeader</td>\n                    <td>The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to an action.
